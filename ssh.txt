Running any composer commands on webhost is via SSH

ssh u87163710@home656220294.1and1-data.host
Pass: (get from vault)

cd stevenmcintosh.co.uk/
cd /Office-Fussball

#/usr/bin/php7.3-cli composer.phar install

Localhost
To send any code amends to the repo
#git push origin master


On Stevenmcintosh.co.uk you should only pull new code from the repo
#git pull origin master

(Note: the only files you want to ever avoid pulling (or you’ll overwrite and need to re-edit) is the:
- Config/config.php (we don’t want to edit DB login credentials)
- .htaccess files (these point to different roots, if overriding you;ll need to change both)
